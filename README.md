# 🛒 Amazon Clone
📌 Project Overview

This project is a front-end Amazon Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective was to learn and implement core JavaScript concepts through a real-world e-commerce simulation. The project includes multiple pages such as Home, Orders, Cart, and Tracking, replicating Amazon’s structure and features while integrating dynamic and interactive functionality.

## 🎯 Features

+ 🏠 Home Page: Displays products dynamically using API calls

+ 🛍️ Cart Page: Add, remove, and update product quantities using DOM manipulation and local storage

+ 📦 Orders Page: Displays previously placed orders

+ 🚚 Tracking Page: Simulates live order tracking (in progress)

+ 🔍 Search Bar: Filters products dynamically based on user input

+ 💾 Local Storage: Used to store cart and order data persistently

+ ✅ Unit Testing with Jasmine: Tests core functions like cart updates and API data handling

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Learned and implemented key JavaScript concepts such as:

    + DOM Manipulation
    
    + Event Handling
    
    + Asynchronous Programming (fetch, async/await)
    
    + Local Storage
    
    + Modular JavaScript (splitting logic into multiple JS files)

- Understood the workflow of a multi-page web application

- Gained experience in unit testing using Jasmine for frontend validation

### 🚀 Tech Stack

- HTML5

- CSS3

- JavaScript (ES6+)

- Jasmine (for unit testing)

- Public Product API – Fake Store API

### 🧩 Testing (Jasmine)

Test cases were written to verify:

- Product rendering and search functionality

- Add/remove cart items and quantity updates

- Local storage operations
